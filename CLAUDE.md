# CLAUDE

This file provides an overview of Fredrik's home directory.

For dotfiles context, read `~/DOTFILES.md`.


## Code Directory

All source code lives in `~/code/` with this structure:

| Path | Purpose | Remote |
|------|---------|--------|
| `knowit/{project}` | Work projects | `github.com/knowit-solutions-cocreate/{project}` |
| `fredrik/{project}` | Personal projects | `github.com/fredrik/{project}` |
| `sandbox/{project}` | Experiments, POC, scratch | Local (may graduate to `fredrik/` or `knowit/`) |
| `others/` | Third-party code. Typically flat. | |

When cloning, place repos according to this convention. Read `~/code/CLAUDE.md` for details.

When Claude generates one-off scripts, put them in `~/code/sandbox/scripts-by-claude`.
