# CLAUDE

This file provides an overview of Fredrik's home directory.

For dotfiles context, read `~/DOTFILES.md`.

## Code Directory

All source code lives in `~/code/` with this structure:

| Path | Purpose | Remote |
|------|---------|--------|
| `knowit/{project}` | Work projects | `github.com/knowit-solutions-cocreate/{project}` |
| `fredrik/{project}` | Personal projects | `github.com/fredrik/{project}` |
| `sandbox/{project}` | Experiments, POC, scratch | Local (may graduate to `fredrik/` or `knowit/`) |
| `others/` | Third-party code. Typically flat. | |

When cloning, place repos according to this convention. Read `~/code/CLAUDE.md` for details.

When Claude generates one-off scripts, put them in `~/code/sandbox/scripts-by-claude`.

## Notes Directory

`~/notes/` is for future-reference material — "how I did it", useful resources, sources found along the way. Markdown files, flat by topic.

## Research Directory

`~/research/` is for focused Claude research sessions that generate material on a specific topic. Organized per topic as `{topic}/*.md`.
